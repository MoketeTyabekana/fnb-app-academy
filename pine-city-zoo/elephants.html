            <h1>ELEPHANTS</h1>
            <p>
              Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the
              order Proboscidea. Two species are traditionally recognised, the
              African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant
              (Elephas maximus). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan
              Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Male African elephants are
              the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4
              m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable
              of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes,
              particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their
              incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools
              for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to
              control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry
              their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave
              backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level
              backs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats
              including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to
              stay near water.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h2>
            <p>
              You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the
              amphitheatre.
